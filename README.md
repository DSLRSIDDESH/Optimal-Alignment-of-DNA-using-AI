# Optimal-Alignment-of-DNA-using-AI

In DNA sequence alignment, the goal is to find the optimal alignment between two DNA sequences by inserting gaps or mismatches to maximize the similarity or minimize the dissimilarity between the sequences. Here A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal alignment by exploring different alignment possibilities and evaluating their costs based on a heuristic function.

The heuristic function used is as the number of mismatches between the two sequences.

For example, consider the following two DNA sequences:

Sequence 1: A T C G A T G C A T

Sequence 2: A T G C A T C G T A

 

The heuristic estimates the number of mismatches between the two sequences and provides an estimate of the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) needed to align the sequences.

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a complex molecule that carries genetic information in living organisms. It consists of long chains of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. There are four types of nucleotides in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These nucleotides are arranged in a specific sequence along the DNA chain, and the sequence of nucleotides determines the genetic code that governs the characteristics and traits of an organism.
